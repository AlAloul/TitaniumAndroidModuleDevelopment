#Ti.AppLifecycle


##foreGround/backGround
An android app is a container of activities and other components. These activities are the visible screens, with other words the UI for the user. They lifes in lifecycles.

If we have a reference to an activity then we  all events are available, in Titanium too.

Problem: in some cases we need an info about state on app level. The only way is a dirty way to inspect which activity in foreground. If the activity is changed then we can fire an event.
