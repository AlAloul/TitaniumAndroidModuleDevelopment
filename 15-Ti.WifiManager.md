Ti.WifiManager
=============
Setup
-----
First we start The Appcelerator Studio and create a new module. 
After this we open CLI, goes to the android folder in it and modify build.properties.

In folder android/src/de-appwerft.wifimanager we see two files:
Wifimanager.java and
ExampleProxy.java

We open the module file and strip all unused parts. In header of class we put all constants from original api description.
After this we rename ExampleProxy.java to WifiManagerProxy.java

After stripping of unsed stuff we see this code:
```java
package de.appwerft.wifimanager;
@Kroll.proxy(creatableInModule = WifimanagerModule.class)
public class WifiManagerProxy extends KrollProxy {
	// Standard Debugging variables
	private static final String LCAT = WifimanagerModule.LCAT;
	private WifiManager manager;

	// Constructor
	public WifiManagerProxy() {
		super();
	}

	// Handle creation options
	@Override
	public void handleCreationDict(KrollDict options) {
		super.handleCreationDict(options);
		init();
	}
}
```
The meaning of this proxy is to expose native classes. In our case it is WifiManager.  Therefore we add a private variable `manager` from type `WiFiManager`

If the Javascript layer calls `Module.createWifiManager()`, then internally the class will instanciated by `new`. The constructor parameters doesn't run in constructor, for this is a special method `handleCreationDict`. After this we call a private method `init()`.

##Init()

This "constructor" create a new instance of manager:
```java
manager = (WifiManager) TiApplication.getInstance().getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);
```

##The trick
The javascript call `createWifiManager()` returns a proxy and a property of this proxy is the native object.  The proxy is quasi a "container" for native objects. 

##getConfiguredNetworks()
For usage of this native methode we write a Kroll.method:
```java
@Kroll.method
public List<WifiConfiguration> getConfiguredNetworks() {
    List<WifiConfiguration> = manager.getConfiguredNetworks();
}
````
`manager` is our native object and we can cann this native methode on it. But what is with result value `List<WifiConfiguration>`?  Because we need a javascript reference for it, we need a proxy `WifiConfigurationProxy` too.
And we modify the method to:
```java
@Kroll.method
public List<WifiConfigurationProxy> getConfiguredNetworks() {
	List<WifiConfigurationProxy> proxylist = new ArrayList<WifiConfigurationProxy>();
	for (WifiConfiguration conf : manager.getConfiguredNetworks()) {
		proxylist.add(new WifiConfigurationProxy(conf));
	}
	return proxylist;
}
```
It is the same trick as before: we pack the `WifiConfiguration` in a `WifiConfigurationProxy` and returns to JS layer. Now we could call methods on native object WifiConfiguration. `
For this we need a `WifiConfigurationProxy` with `WifiConfiguration` as constructor parameter:

```java
public class WifiConfigurationProxy extends KrollProxy {
	private static final String LCAT = WifimanagerModule.LCAT;
	private WifiConfiguration conf;

	public WifiConfigurationProxy(WifiConfiguration conf) {
		super();
		this.conf = conf;
	}
}
```
