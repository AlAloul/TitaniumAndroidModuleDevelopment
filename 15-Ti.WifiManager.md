Ti.WifiManager
=============
Setup
-----
First we start The Appcelerator Studio and create a new module. 
After this we open CLI, goes to the android folder in it and modify build.properties.

In folder android/src/de-appwerft.wifimanager we see two files:
Wifimanager.java and
ExampleProxy.java

We open the module file and strip all unused parts. In header of class we put all constants from original api description.
After this we rename ExampleProxy.java to WifiManagerProxy.java
