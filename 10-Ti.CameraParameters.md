#Ti.CameraParameters

For some reason some people needs details about all embedded cameras in a phone. This module exposes all needed informations.

##Basics
The module only statically ask the system, therefore we don't need a proxy â€“ a module is enough.
The walking thrue system needs time and is a good though to realize this as async task. Therefore we cannot work with result => we need callbacks.

##Implementation
First we transfer  the javascript callbacks to java KrollFunctions in the single exported method:
```java
public void getAllCams(KrollDict opts) {
		if (opts != null && opts instanceof KrollDict) {
			if (opts.containsKeyAndNotNull("onSuccess")) {
				successCallback = (KrollFunction) opts.get("onSuccess");
			}
			if (opts.containsKeyAndNotNull("onError")) {
				errorCallback = (KrollFunction) opts.get("onError");
			}
```
If the javascript coder forget or mistyped, then nothing happens. ;-))
All the stuff runs in a second thread (async task):
```java
	AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void> doRequest = new AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void>() {
				@Override
				protected Void doInBackground(Void[] dummy) {
```

The currentActivity we need for asking for permissions and the context we need for getting the Camera systemService. 
```java
Activity currentActivity = TiApplication.getInstance()
							.getCurrentActivity();
Context context = TiApplication.getInstance()
							.getApplicationContext();
```
For building of result object we need a KrollDict (resultDict) and for property 'cameras' an Arraylist (listOfCameras) object.
```java
KrollDict resultDict = new KrollDict();
ArrayList<KrollDict> listOfCameras = new ArrayList<KrollDict>();
```
For newest devices with Marshmellow we need to ask by CAMERA permissions:
```java
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
	if (currentActivity .checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED) {
		resultDict.put("error","No permission to access camera manager.");
			if (errorCallback != null)
			errorCallback.call(getKrollObject(), resultDict);
	}
}
```			
If permission is not granted, the function will stopped and the user gets an error callback.

Unfortunately we need different APIs for older and newer Android levels. This depend on level on device, not on compiler sdk level. 

For older devices the 'android.hardware.Camera' API is right. 
It is relative simple:
