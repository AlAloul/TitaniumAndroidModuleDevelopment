#Ti.AudioVisualizerView

The android system provides the class [Visualizer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/Visualizer.html). If instantiated the class deliver us the level and the fastfourier of AudioPlayer output or AudioTrack. Every sound source has a audioSessionId, the mixer out has '0'.
