#Ti.Airlino

This tutorial shows, how you can implement  a REST interface in titanium and later how you can user a ready to use library (class) of Android to bild i.e. a Bonjour browser.

First we build a native module (without Titanium stuff). Therefore we can use this package later in noTitanium projects.

##AirlinoAdapter.java

Airlino is a hardware device for receiving streamed audio data and for playing audio URLs. Maybe some users has more then one of this black boxes and therefore we need instances. The protocol is for all function http/POST/JSON. The pdf with detailled  protocol description you can find [here](https://github.com/AppWerft/Ti.Airlino/blob/master/SPEC_HBM10-v4.2.0.pdf).

There are a lot of http clients for android/java. In this solution we use  [ AsyncHttpClient](http://loopj.com/android-async-http/).
