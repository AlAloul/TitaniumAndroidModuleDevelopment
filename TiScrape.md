Ti.Scrape
=========

In last module [Ti.TimeZone](TimeZone.md) we used only system functions. In this module we try to use third-party libs. This is a big step and very useful ;-)

We have two possibilities: we import a compiled jar file (it is a zip and contains class files) or we import the sources. In our little demo we use both ways.
