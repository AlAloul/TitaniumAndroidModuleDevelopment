In this lecture I explain how we can use Android libs from github or other open source depots for building an Android module.

We found on github this nice ActivityIndicator with progress and plan a converting. First we go into example and we find in [MainActivity.java] this line

```java
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
```

WTF is this R?
