#Ti.AudioControls

For an AudioPlayer inside an app we need "remote" controls to watch meta details and control (play/stop/skip).
We use three ways:

1. listener on "keyboard" on a headset
2. Widget over lockscreen (only available for older devices)
3. Widget in notification (only available for newer devices)

###Headphone buttons
If we nothing do then the following automatism is working: if a headphone with 4 contacts is plugged, then the clicking of main button (in the middle) starts the player which has focus. Therefore the Titanium AudioPlayer can control with it. If you need an other behaviour (usage of double click for other function), then you can use [Ti.HeadphoneButtons](https://github.com/AppWerft/Ti.HeadphoneButtons).

###Widgets
For remote controling you can use a strip in notification tray (prefered solution) or a widget over lockscreen. This lockscreen widget is only available for older devices. Since Lollipop this feature will not supported.


### Javascript interface (aka "usage")

This is the Javascript interface:

```javascript
var AudioControls = require("de.appwerft.audiocontrols");
var Lorem = require("vendor/loremipsum");

AudioControls.createRemoteAudioControl({
			onKeypressed : function(_event) {
				console.log(_event);
			},
			lollipop : AudioControls.WIDGET_NOTIFICATION,
		});
AudioControls.updateRemoteAudioControl({
			image : "http://lorempixel.com/120/120/cats" + "?_=" + Math.random(),
			artist : Lorem(10),
			title : Lorem(2)
		});
		setInterval(function() {
			AudioControls.updateRemoteAudioControl({
				image : "http://lorempixel.com/120/120/cats" + "?_=" + Math.random(),
				artist : Lorem(12),
				title : Lorem(4)
			});
		}, 30000);
```

Lollipop devices 21/22 supports both types of widget, with the parameters the user can select one type.
