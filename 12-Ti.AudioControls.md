#Ti.AudioControls

For an AudioPlayer inside an app we need "remote" controls to watch meta details and control (play/stop/skip).
We use three ways:

1. listener on "keyboard" on a headset
2. Widget over lockscreen (only available for older devices)
3. Widget in notification (only available for newer devices)

The events listening from widgets and headset will realize with broadcastreceivers. The control of widgets is realize with services which build widgets.
